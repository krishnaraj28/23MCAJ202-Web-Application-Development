            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of web development, used to structure and display content on webpages. It consists of elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and forms, which define the layout and organization of a page. HTML works alongside CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, making it a fundamental technology for building modern websites. It follows a tag-based syntax, where each element is enclosed within opening and closing tags. With the latest version, HTML5, new features like audio, video, and semantic elements have enhanced web development, making it more efficient and accessible.
            An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.The external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The file must not contain any HTML code, and must be saved with a .css extension.</p>
