    <p>A planet is a celestial body that orbits a star, has enough gravity to maintain a roughly spherical shape, and has cleared its orbit of other debris. Planets come in different types, such as rocky planets like Earth and Mars or gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn. They can support various environments, some with conditions suitable for life. Scientists continue to explore planets within and beyond our solar system, searching for new worlds and potential signs of extraterrestrial life.</p>
